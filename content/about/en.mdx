# Hey there 👋 I'm Victor Philippe

I'm a **developer from Liège**, now in Brussels, with a passion for backend systems, DevOps, and building cool things with code. Currently a student at **Campus19 (42 Network)**, I love tackling low-level challenges in **C/C++**, optimizing server performance, and containerizing apps with **Docker**.

---

## 🚀 What I’m All About

I believe that clean code, well-thought-out architecture, and a bit of automation magic can make software both powerful and joyful to use. Whether it's configuring a secure Nginx reverse proxy, implementing epoll in a C++ web server, or spinning up a full microservice stack — I'm in my zone.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: C, C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Web Stack**: Node.js, Express, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **DevOps**: Docker, Nginx, TLS, .env configs, shared networks

## 🧩 Selected Projects

### 🎮 3D Pong Game  
An old classic, reimagined in 3D using **Babylon.js**. Built for the web and surprisingly competitive.

### 🤖 Blinest Blindtest Bot  
A Discord bot that brings music quiz games to your server — custom-built in JavaScript with Node.js.

### 🔐 Secure WordPress Stack (Docker)  
A production-ready, TLS-secured Docker setup with **Nginx**, **MariaDB**, and **WordPress**, using shared networks and minimal volume usage.
