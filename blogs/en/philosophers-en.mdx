# Philosophers: The Dining Philosophers Problem

As part of the 42 Network at Campus 19 in Brussels, I tackled the classic **Dining Philosophers** concurrency problem.  
The goal was to correctly manage shared resources (forks) between philosophers without causing deadlock or starvation, using threads and mutexes.

Core concepts:
- Thread creation and management
- Mutex-based synchronization
- Deadlock prevention
- Timing constraints

A crucial project for understanding real-world multithreaded applications!
