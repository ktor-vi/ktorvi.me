# Inception: Full Infrastructure with Docker

At **Campus 19 (42 Network) in Brussels**, I created **Inception**, a full web infrastructure using Docker containers.  
The project consists of setting up services like Nginx, WordPress, MariaDB, and Redis in isolated containers, using Docker Compose for orchestration.

Key components:
- Reverse proxy (Nginx)
- CMS (WordPress)
- Database (MariaDB)
- Cache system (Redis)
- SSL/TLS encryption with self-signed certificates

A deep dive into containerization and system orchestration!
