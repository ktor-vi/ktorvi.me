# Web Serv: Building an HTTP/1.1 Web Server

As part of the 42 Network curriculum at Campus 19 in Brussels, I developed **Web Serv**, a complete HTTP/1.1 web server written in C++.  
This project was an opportunity to explore how real-world servers like Nginx and Apache function internally, including request parsing, socket programming, and configuration handling.

The project includes:
- Static file serving
- Basic CGI handling
- Support for GET, POST, and DELETE methods
- Custom error pages
- Connection multiplexing with `poll`

It was a deep dive into low-level networking and HTTP protocol management.  
You can check the project here: [web_serv on GitHub](https://github.com/ktor-vi/web_serv).
