# C++ Modules at 42 Network

At **Campus 19 (42 Network) in Brussels**, I worked through the **C++ Modules** project series.  
This repository contains my solutions for modules 00 to 09, each focused on mastering modern C++ concepts: object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, operator overloading, and more.

Each module was a practical step deeper into understanding the real-world usage of C++.
