# So Long: A Minimal 2D Game

At **Campus 19 (42 Network) in Brussels**, I developed **So Long**, a small 2D game using the MiniLibX graphical library.  
The player navigates through a maze, collects items, and reaches an exit while avoiding obstacles.

Features:
- Simple 2D grid-based map parsing
- Player movement and collision
- Event-driven programming (keyboard inputs)
- Basic animations

A fun introduction to graphical programming in C!
