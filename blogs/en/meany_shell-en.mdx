# MiniShell: Crafting a Minimalist Shell

At **Campus 19 (42 Network) in Brussels**, I developed **MiniShell**, a minimal shell replicating basic Bash functionalities.  
This project involved parsing user input, managing environment variables, handling pipes and redirections, and executing commands via system calls.

Main features:
- Built-in commands (cd, echo, env, export, unset, exit)
- Pipelines and I/O redirections
- Signal handling (CTRL+C, CTRL+\)
- Environment management

An exciting challenge to dive deeper into Unix internals!
